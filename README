Gimokod Linux

Yet another distro.

So straight to the details.
Pacman for package management--I had the option of using Pkgin/Pkgsrc but Pacman/ABS was so much easier to work with. I'm aiming for a very small footprint. No NLS support, multilib, texinfo manuals and HTML docs. Removed Perl dependency from ca-certificates and replaced groff for manpage viewing with mdocml. Several components usually provided by GNU utilities are replaced by BusyBox applets, except for coreutils and util-linux.

You can think of it as a distribution between minimal Linux distributions using uClibc/BusyBox and full blown Linux distributions. The initial packages were built in Exherbo but now the base system is able to build itself. The base system and development tools needed to build itself total in at 78 packages only.

I believe it's easier to secure and maintain a host if the packages are kept simple and minimum as much as possible.

Arch Linux updates its packages frequentlty so ABS is good for monitoring updates. I also watch the Gentoo, Exherbo, Openwall, AlpineLinux, Mandriva, Debian and openSUSE repositories for useful updates and fixes.

The kernel will be close to vanilla as much as possible but I'll probably sync up with gentoo-sources. Built-in tests are run and checked for 0 unexpected failures in the following packages:

gcc
binutils
glibc
gmp
mpfr
mpc
openssl
zlib
nss

Misc features:
/etc/tcb support courtesy of Openwall and Mandriva patches
read-only root filesystem (made possible by Systemd)
